Website comments
----------------

`draft` `optional`

This a method to have comments or a conversation around an URL. Without this method someone would have to post a link to a page in a `kind:1` event and then others can reply to it, but that puts the conversation around the *author* posting that URL. This spec tries to de-emphasize the author of the root post and make the primary focus on the URL instead.

By using a `kind:443` URL event with the URL as an `r` tag, clients create a root event for the URL. Multiple authors can post the same URL, but to the client it should be treated as a single (virtual) root post, the root being a single URL.

The `kind:443` URL event by itself is not enough, a normal `kind:1` reply to the `kind:443` event is where the actual conversation happens.

## Events

### `kind:443` URL event that represents a page or website
```json
{
  "pubkey": "9be0be0e64d38a29a9cec9a5c8ef5d873c2bfa5362a4b558da5ff69bc3cbb81e",
  "id": "8c6ae3ecdc7380ad7bd6c0c2b2039f7f5faf1cf1ba2aaa040a594d15629bae14",
  "content": "Comments on nostur.com", // alt text for clients that don't support kind:443
  "kind": 443,
  "tags": [
    [
      "r", "https://nostur.com" // The URL (required)
    ]
  ]
}
```

### `kind:1` reply that represents a comment or reply on a page or website
```json
// Should be like any other kind 1 reply, but with the `e` tag referring to the `kind:443` URL event
{
  "pubkey": "9be0be0e64d38a29a9cec9a5c8ef5d873c2bfa5362a4b558da5ff69bc3cbb81e",
  "id": "26d6a50b447153848f365d11e56fb65a066a41fc5729c5a392032670fe7bb812",
  "content": "Your website looks old", // The comment or reply text, same as any normal `kind:1`
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    [
      "e",
      "8c6ae3ecdc7380ad7bd6c0c2b2039f7f5faf1cf1ba2aaa040a594d15629bae14" // id of the `kind:443` URL that is being replied to
      "",
      "root"
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Creating replies or comments

When someone makes a new comment on a website, clients should send a `kind:1` reply to a `kind:443` URL event.

Clients can either use an existing `kind:443` event for that URL or create a new one, it is ok to have multiple `kind:443` events for the same URL, but it is recommended to reuse an existing one to make querying for all replies easier.

## Reading replies or comments:
Clients that display `kind:1` replies should show the reply not to the author of the `kind:443` URL event, but to the URL in the `r` tag of the `kind:443` URL event.

It is recommended to have a special view that displays the URL as root without author.

Replies to different `kind:443` events that have the same URL in the `r` tag should be treated as replies to the same URL, as if there were only 1 single `kind:443` event for that URL.

### Fetching replies to a URL in 2 steps:
1) Fetch all `kind:443` URL events for that URL:
```json
["REQ","sub1",{"kinds":[443],"#r":["https://nostur.com"]}]
```
2) Fetch all `kind:1` replies to the resulting ids of the previous request:
```json
["REQ","sub2",{"kinds":[1],"#e":[<kind 443 ids here>]}]
```
