Client Identification Metadata
------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

Client Identification Metadata is information included in a nostr event to let others know from which client the event was generated. The main use case is showing from which client someone posted something and help nostr users discover different clients.

For example: "Posted via Nostur"

Client Identification Metadata is a `client` tag that looks like this:

```json
{
  "content": "Good morning!",
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    [
      "client",
      "Nostur" // client name
      "31990:9be0be0fc079548233231614e4e1efc9f28b0db398011efeecf05fe570e5dd33:1685868693432" // reference to a kind:31990 as specified in NIP-89
      "wss://nos.lol" // relay url
    ]
  ]
}
```

The `client` tag MUST include the `client name`. The reference to `kind:31990` and the `relay url` are OPTIONAL, allowing clients that fully implement NIP-89 to show rich information about a client, but also allow clients that don't to still easily show client information by just reading the required `client name` value.

It is recommended to keep the `client name` short without version numbers or other additional information to prevent running into screen space problems when other clients try to render your client name.
