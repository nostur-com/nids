Pinned post
-----------

`draft` `optional`

A pinned post is a `kind 10601` event that is used to pin a single post more prominently on someone's profile and show it as a collection of recently pinned posts in a feed.

The `content` of a pinned post event MUST be _the stringified JSON of the post to be pinned_. (similar as reposts)

The post to be pinned MUST have the same `pubkey` as the pinned post event.

The pinned post event MUST include an `e` tag with the `id` of the post that is
being pinned. 

If the post to be pinned is an addressable event, an `a` SHOULD be included together with the `e` tag, it must be set to the coordinates (`kind:pubkey:d-tag`) of the event to be pinned.

The pinned post event SHOULD contain a `k` tag with the stringified kind number
of the pinned event as its value.


Pinned posts should also be added to NIP-51 kind 10001 (Pinned notes)

The pinned post event is used to highlight a single post per user in a normal following feed.
It is recommended that clients fetching pinned posts throttle displaying them to 1 pinned posts every 48 hours to prevent abuse.
Kind 10601 is replacable so it will only have the latest pinned post.
