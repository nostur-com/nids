Pinned Post
-----------

`draft` `optional`

A Pinned Post is a `kind 10601` event that is used to pin a single post more prominently on the author's own profile and also to make it possible for nostr clients to show a collection of recently pinned posts by multiple authors in a feed.

The `content` of a Pinned Post event MUST be _the stringified JSON of the post to be pinned_. (similar as in reposts)

The post to be pinned MUST have the same `pubkey` as the Pinned Post event.

The Pinned Post event MUST include an `e` tag with the `id` of the post that is
being pinned. 

If the post to be pinned is an addressable event, an `a` SHOULD be included together with the `e` tag, it must be set to the coordinates (`kind:pubkey:d-tag`) of the event to be pinned.

The Pinned Post event SHOULD contain a `k` tag with the stringified kind number
of the post being pinned as its value.

When a post is pinned, it (the inner event, not kind 10601) should also be added to NIP-51 kind 10001 (Pinned notes)

By fetching Pinned Post events from multiple authors a collection of recently pinned posts can be shown in a feed.
It is recommended that clients fetching Pinned Post throttle displaying them to 1 pinned post every 48 hours for each author to prevent abuse.
Kind 10601 is replacable so relays will only return the latest pinned post from from each author.
